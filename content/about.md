## Quick Facts
Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a Software Engineer by trade, a Computer Scientist and 
Physicist by education, a Christian, husband, and father by God's great grace.
I live in Chattanooga, TN with my wife Shelby, work remotely for 
[Shearwater Technology Inc.](https://shearwater-tech.com), and am a member at 
[Christ Reformed Baptist Church](https://crbchattanooga.org).

## Family
I am blissfully married to my wife of 6 years, Shelby. We are about to welcome
our first child into the world.

## Work and Education
I attended Samford University, graduating in the class of 2018 with a Bachelors
of Science in Computer Science and Engineering Physics and a minor in Math.

Ever since I've been working at Shearwater Tech as a Research and Development
Engineer, where I've been developing tools for automating simulation workflows,
automating 3D geometry and mesh generation, performing engineering analysis,
and Linux, Mac, and Windows system administration.

I write in Python and all it's associated libraries

## Church
CRBC is our church home. We moved to Chattanooga to be members here, we were
looking for a confessional Reformed Baptist church a few years ago, and the
opportunity came up so we took it. We have been thoroughly blessed by the 
faithful preaching of God's Word, and all the means of grace here.

## Hobbies
I use Linux, btw.
