## Quick Facts
Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a Software Engineer by trade, a Computer Scientist and 
Physicist by education, a Christian, husband, and father by God's great grace.
I live in Chattanooga, TN with my wife Shelby, work remotely for 
[Shearwater Technology Inc.](https://shearwater-tech.com), and am a member of 
[Christ Reformed Baptist Church](https://crbchattanooga.org).

## Family
I am blissfully married to my wife of 6 years, Shelby. We are about to welcome
our first child into the world!

## Work and Education
I attended Samford University, graduating in the class of 2018 with a Bachelors
of Science in Computer Science and Engineering Physics and a minor in Math.

Ever since I've been working at Shearwater Tech as a Research and Development
Engineer, where I've been developing tools for automating simulation workflows,
automating 3D geometry and mesh generation, performing engineering analysis,
and Linux, Mac, and Windows system administration.

I mostly write code in Python and all it's associated libraries like Numpy,
Pandas, Plotly, Dash, Flask, and more. I also write Java, Golang, C++,
GDScript, and SQL. 

## Church
CRBC is our church home. We moved to Chattanooga to be members here, we are
blessed to be a part of a confessional Reformed Baptist church, rooted in the
Scripture and the historic Baptist tradition. The Word of God is the only rule
of faith and practice and by its light sinners separated from God can and do 
find eternal life in Christ Jesus, the only Son from the Father full of grace
and truth. I believe that the 2nd London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 is
a faithful witness of the doctrines laid out in the Bible, standing the test of
time these past 335 years. 

## Hobbies
I use Linux, btw.
