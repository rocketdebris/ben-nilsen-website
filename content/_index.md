Welcome to my website! Professionally I am a passionate Computer Scientist,
Physicist, and Software Developer. I am interested in simulation, data, code
quality, high performance code, and free and open source software. Personally I
am a Christian, husband, and very soon a father. It is my intent to write about
all these things as the fancy strikes including technology tutorials, development
logs, things I'm learning and passionate about, and maybe even theology. Thanks
for coming along for the ride!
