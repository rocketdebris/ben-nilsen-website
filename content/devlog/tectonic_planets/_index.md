# Tectonic Planets
This is a dream project of mine, I'm building a planetary evolution simulator
generating a realistic planetary surface heightmap from an initial set of
tectonic plates and initial plate motion vectors. I'm rather sick of seeing
bland non-physical fractal planets in video games and movies. The believability
of a planetary surface grounds us and helps us feel engaged. In the same way
that CGI faces feel fake, so too do fantastical landscapes and entire planets 
made up of a single biome.
